# Todo

* Clean up code for pulling forms and tasks from the server (maybe create
  objects representing tasks and forms for easier mental operations)
* Implement cleaner approach to authorization
* Separate code into various files to make browsing it earlier
* Maybe break up code into components that can be plugged together
* Squash all the migrations, they're getting ugly
